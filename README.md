# 🛒 Ecommerce Cart Abandonment SQL Analysis

This project analyzes cart abandonment behavior using SQL queries on a retail dataset. It focuses on identifying patterns, frequently abandoned products, and customer drop-off points.

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered
- What are the top 5 most abandoned products?
- Which customers have the highest cart abandonment rate?
- How does cart timing relate to abandonment?

## 🧠 Learnings
- Refreshed use of subqueries and CTEs to modularize logic.
- Applied SQL window functions for ranking products.
- Improved query structuring and clarity.

## ⚠️ Limitation
The dataset only includes **abandoned carts**, so we couldn’t compare with successfully completed ones. A future improvement could involve adding synthetic or real purchase data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- SQL (PostgreSQL/BigQuery-style)
- Power BI (used for visualizing in other projects)
- VS Code + GitHub for collaboration
